# gettingadncleaningdataCP

This repo contains only one script (run_analysis.R). The script reads a dataset of data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and creates two files (mean_by_activity_and_subject_dataset.txt	and mean_sd_dataset.txt). The first contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. While the second, contains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
